# Tags
# A RetroFuturaGradle concept akin to Ant ReplaceTokens
# A class is generated at build-time for compilation, to describe properties that have values that could change at build time such as versioning

# Tag properties can be stated in the `tags.properties` file, references are allowed

# Access Transformers
# A way to change visibility of Minecraft's classes, methods and fields
# An example access transformer file is given in the path: `src/main/resources/example_at.cfg`
# AT files should be in the root of src/main/resources with the filename formatted as: `mod_id_at.cfg`

# Mixins
# Powerful tool to do runtime description changes of classes, wiki: https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/wiki

# Use the property `mixin_refmap` if you want it to use a different name, only one name is accepted

# Coremods
# The most powerful way to change java classes at runtime, it is however very primitive with little documentation.

# You MUST state a class name for `coremod_plugin_class_name` if you are making a coremod, the class should implement `IFMLLoadingPlugin`
